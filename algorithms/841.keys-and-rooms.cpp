 *
 * [841] Keys and Rooms
 *
 * There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1Â and all the rooms are locked
 * except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot
 * enter a locked room without having its key.
 *
 * When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key
 * has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of
 * them with you to unlock the other rooms.
 *
 * Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain
 * if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false
 * otherwise.
